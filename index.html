			<h1>CALL FOR APPLICATIONS</h1>
			<h2>WE&rsquo;RE BACK!</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>Yes folks the Short and Sharp is back and we&rsquo;re looking for new Short Film applications. </p>

			<p>Applications open: Thursday 1st August 2013 Applications close: Monday 7th Oct 2013 Short list announced: early December</p>

			<p>We will be looking for original scripts that have a beginning, middle and an end.</p>

			<p>The end is very important. It&rsquo;s the last thing you leave your audience with so if it doesn&rsquo;t work then chances are your film won&rsquo;t. Stories aren&rsquo;t judged on the journey. They are judged on the destination. What is the feeling you want to leave your audience with? Is there a message you want them to take away? Is it a feeling? A smile? A tear? A sense of unease? A big scare? </p>

			<p>Imagine a joke without a punch line. A really good joke that builds and builds and then has no conclusion? Or, even worse, a punch line that doesn&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s how important your ending is to your audience. Do I know the ending of my story? Am I working towards it? When the lights come up after your film screens how will you have affected your audience?</p>

			<p>Punch lines don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that we are looking for funny scripts. It&rsquo;s simply an example we&rsquo;d like you to keep in mind when you&rsquo;re writing or constructing your screenplay. We want stories. Good stories. That pack a punch. </p>

			<p>We are also looking for stories that contain characters that have a clear sense of who and what they are. Characters that have truth about them. That avoid the clich&eacute;&rsquo;s and when they open their mouths the words they speak do more than simply move the plot along. Heroes do not walk into a room and announce that they are heroes. Instead they behave in a heroic manner and we know they are heroes. </p>

			<p>Dialogue isn&rsquo;t just for feeding information, it is a game we play with our audience that includes them in a conversation and treats them with enough respect that they will come to their own conclusions. Also, do your characters need to talk at all? Actions, as the old adage goes, speak louder than words. </p>

			<p>Finally and most importantly we are looking for originality. A story and characters that we might not have seen before. Immerse yourself in New Zealand short films, study what has gone before. Chances are you will see a lot of patterns repeating themselves. If your story is exploring characters or situations that have appeared in Kiwi short films before then stop and think again. Create a new, original story. </p>

			<p>We are looking for stories that are concise, original, well-told and populated with memorable characters. Short and sharp. </p>

			<p>That is your challenge.  </p>

	<p>Short and Sharp is extremely proud to announce the two film that will produced under our pod this year. The teams have put everything into getting their projects over the line and we couldn’t be happier not only with their commitment to the process but also their commitment to telling a well-crafted story. It can only get better from here. WE can’t wait to get these projects into production and onto a screen near you soon. </p>

	<p>Two men recovering from a night out drinking find themselves in the dark on an endless stretch of ice. Soon they begin to wonder if this is the end, or just the beginning…</p>
	<p>An intriguing premise that pays off with humor, pathos and bittersweet warmth. This team has worked extremely hard and have a unique, well-crafted vision for a clever, charming and disarming film. This one gave us shivers, if you’ll excuse the pun.</p><br />

	<p>A magical, modern fable. A beardless man enters a beard-growing competition to win a meat raffle for himself and his dog.</p>
	
	<p>An extremely capable team have brought together a story that is the pure essence of  a good old-fashion kiwi yarn. This is a film that has vision and skill brought together in a surprising film that isn’t afraid to get a bit hairy.

<!-- TEAMS -->
<div id="teams_cont" style="display:none;">
	<p>It goes with saying that we are looking for submissions from experienced teams. Although we will look at scripts from writers that do not have a producer or director attached, we would prefer that the team is already formed. </p>
<p>Film making is a team effort. The relationships that you build in this industry as the key creative’s are extremely important. Working on a project like this will let you find the strengths and the common goals of your team. </p>
<p>You must seek out people who are as passionate and have equally a strong desire to make the same film. This passion will help you work together. With any luck the team you form on this project will go on to work together in the future. As Rick says at the end of <i>Casablanca</i> - “Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” </p>
<p>Directors must have some directing experience in a short film, television drama, feature film or TVC’s with drama content. Producers must have production or producing experience.</p>
<p>We have a limit of two submissions per individual/team. </p>
</div>

<!-- IMPORTANT INFO -->
<div id="info_cont" style="display:none;">
	<p> The shorter the better. 5 pages or less will be at the very top of our pile. Then scripts 10 pages or less will be read next, then scripts 15 pages or under will be read. Remember the important rule of thumb - 1 page = 1 minute. </p>
	<p>Initially projects will be judged on the strength of the screenplay and then look at the teams. Once we have our short list of 6 we will set up meetings with shortlisted teams. </p>
	<p>Show reels will be requested as and when required. Applications open - Monday August 6 Applications close - Friday October 5 Applications assessed - October/November Shortlist of six announced - Monday 26 November Funding Decisions announced - January 2013 Funded Films to be delivered - March 2014 The six short listed teams will then meet with the EP’s; they will be required to produce a final shooting script, budget, estimated production schedule and any visuals or storyboards. </p>
	<p>Final selection of the two films will be announced January 2013. The final teams will meet with the EP’s for any further development on the script plus locking down the budget and production schedule. This is the time when we will all start working together to bring your story to the screen. </p>
	<p>Please also read the following information from the NZFC and be aware of it before making your submission:</p>
	<p>All short films funded by NZ Film Commission must contain significant New Zealand content and the film makers must be NZ citizens or residents.</p>
	<p>Directors who have had NZFC production or post production financing for a low budget film (narrative or documentary) are eligible to apply to the Premiere Shorts scheme on the basis that the proposed short film will enable them to deliver a film to the festival / marketplace that is significantly different from previous work (e.g. higher production values, drama rather than doco etc). Directors can be funded through Premiere Shorts a maximum of two times. With Fresh Shorts available as a funding option the NZFC has a clearer focus on the Premiere Shorts funding being allocated to directors with a proven directing track record and with a feature film career in active progress. This means investment preference will be given to directors and teams who already have a feature film script in development (whether privately or with the NZFC) and can discuss their career aspirations and intentions in practical terms. At a Premiere Shorts level the NZFC expects film makers to be using their professional judgment to decide which projects are appropriate for a $90,000 investment vs the $30,000 or $10,000 investment available at Fresh Shorts level. While it is possible to apply for both levels of funding the applications would need to reflect considerable changes in approach at both a directing and producing level. If a Premiere Short is invited to an eligible A-list festival (see the NZ Film Commission short film post production guidelines for a list of qualifying festivals) it may also qualify for completion funds of up to $15,000 to finish the film to 35mm - depending on the formats required by the festival. Please email Premiere Shorts Assistant – Hayden Ellis (<a href="mailto:hayden@nzfilm.co.nz">hayden@nzfilm.co.nz</a>) if you have any questions regarding completion funds.</p>
</div>

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
<div id="req_cont" style="display:none;">
	<ul>
		<li>2 x hard copies of scripts in industry standard format </li>
		<li>A completed application cover sheet <a href="S&S_cover_sheet.pdf">Download Here</a></li>
		<li>Bio/CV’s of the key creative’s (writer, director, producer), maximum of one page</li>
		<li>Director’s treatment, maximum of one page. This is a chance for the director to tell us why they are the right person to direct this project. How they can take the script and translate it into a cinematic event. </li>
	</ul>

<!-- WHO ARE WE? -->
<div id="who_cont" style="display:none;">
  	<p> Short and Sharp is set up by writer Nick Ward and producer Michelle Turner. They have a working friendship that goes back ten years to when they first collaborated on <i>Stickmen</i> and they currently have several feature films in development together. </p><p>Their vision of the type of films they want to make is very similar and this is a working relationship that they see to a future of continuing to make films together.   Remember we will be working with you to make your film a success. We are not just going to hand over a pile of cash and say “go on, have some fun” We will be there to ensure that you have guiding hands through the process. We will bring years of experience and insider knowledge to your project. We’re a bit like a really good cheat sheet. We’ve sat this test before and we know the answers. Joking aside this will be a team effort so it’s important that you like us as much as we like your script because - ultimately - we will all be working together to make it happen.</p><p>We love films and filmmaking and we’re looking forward to helping you make your film into reality. A great film we can all be proud of.</p>
